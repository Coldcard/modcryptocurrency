# Bitcoin and Crypto Algorithms for Micropython
## modcryptocurrency

This project aims to take the Micropython integration from
`trezor-core/embed/extmod/modtrezorcrypto`
and make it useful to other embedded cryptocurrency projects.

Changes:

- shorten the module name to something easier to type
- fix minor build issues

# Credits

This code is 99% written by the fine folks at Trezor. They created
the optimized C-language code and also the micropython compatibility layer.

# Licence

GPL v3 like the original material.
